# --- Vivado Project Ignore Rules ---

# 1. Vivado Generated Directories
# These contain synthesis/implementation results, simulation data, IP output products, cache, etc.
# They can be large and should be regenerated from sources.
*.cache/
*.gen/
*.runs/
*.sim/
*_base/
work/
# sim/
*.hw/
# Add similar patterns if you have multiple block designs or different source sets

# 2. Vivado Generated Files
*.log
*.jou # Journal files (Vivado command history)
*.str # Vivado crash status files
*.rpt # Report files
*.pb # Protocol buffer files (often implementation status)
*.dcp # Design Checkpoints (can be very large)
*.bit # Bitstream files
*.bin # Binary programming files
*.ltx # Logic Analyzer files
*.mcs # PROM files
*.prm # PROM files metadata
*.wdb # Waveform Database files (Simulation results)
*.wcfg # Waveform configuration files (often user-specific layouts)
vivado*.backup.zip # Backup zip files created by Vivado
vivado_pid*.zip # Vivado process ID related zip files (crash logs etc.)
*.html # HTML reports
*.xml # Various generated XML reports/metadata (be cautious, some might be needed, but often not)
*.osv # Object files for VHDL simulation libraries (rarely needed in repo)
*.mem # Memory initialization files generated during synthesis/implementation (keep source .coe or .mif)
*.xsa

# 3. Project File Backups
*.xpr.zip # Project backup zip files
*.xpr.bak # Project backup files

# 4. Vitis / SDK Generated Files (if applicable)

# --- Files to KEEP (Ensure these are NOT ignored) ---
# Generally, you don't need explicit "keep" rules unless a pattern above
# accidentally ignores something essential. The default is to keep files.
# Example (if needed, unlikely for standard setups):
# !important_config.xml

# --- Best Practices Notes ---
# - Keep your source files (*.vhd, *.v, *.sv)
# - Keep your constraints files (*.xdc)
# - Keep your IP customization files (*.xci)
# - Keep your Block Design files (*.bd)
# - Keep your project file (*.xpr) - Be mindful of merge conflicts on this!
# - Consider using Tcl scripts to generate the project for better version control.
